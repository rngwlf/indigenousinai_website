## Welcome!

Indigenous In AIâ€™s vision is to build an international community of Native, Aboriginal, and First Nations who will collectively transform their home communities with advanced technology. By elevating the voices of Indigenous ML researchers we will inspire future impactful work and break stereotypes. Additionally, this group will strive to educate the broader NeurIPS on contemporary indigenous issues relevant to information technology and practices.
