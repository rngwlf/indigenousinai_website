### Schedule
* Talk: Enabling a sovereign digital future for indigenous languages
* * Abstract: Papa Reo (papareo.nz) is a multilingual language initiative grounded in Indigenous knowledge and ways of thinking and powered by cutting edge data science. We will present our work on the importance of indigenous sovereignty over data, platforms, and technologies used in the preservation, promotion, and revitalisation of language and culture. We will also cover some of our latest tools such as a real time pronunciation model which aims to decolonise the sound of te reo Māori. Papa Reo is led by Te Reo Irirangi o Te Hiku o Te Ika (Te Hiku Media), a charitable media organisation, collectively belonging to the Far North iwi of Ngāti Kuri, Te Aupouri, Ngai Takoto, Te Rārawa and Ngāti Kahu. Te Hiku Media is an iwi communications hub for radio, online video and media services. Māori language revitalisation is a core focus, and Te Hiku Media’s vision and mission were confirmed by a meeting of kaumātua (elders) and other native speakers of Te Reo Māori.
